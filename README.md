# Cipher Techniques
The Cipher Techniques web application is a project focused on enabling users to perform text encryption and decryption using a variety of cryptographic techniques. Developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this application offers a straightforward interface where users can enter plaintext and choose from multiple ciphers such as Affine, Railfence, Atbash, ROT13, Caesar, and Vigen√®re.

Key features include:
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed with simplicity in mind, the interface allows users to interact seamlessly with encryption and decryption functionalities.
- **Dynamic Input Handling**: Implemented JavaScript to dynamically adjust input fields based on the selected cipher, ensuring appropriate parameters are entered for each encryption or decryption operation.
- **Algorithm Implementation**: Each cipher is implemented using JavaScript functions tailored to its specific encryption or decryption logic. This approach ensures accuracy and efficiency in processing user input.
- **Responsive Design**: The application employs responsive design principles to deliver a consistent experience across various devices and screen sizes.

Overall, the Cipher Techniques web application combines front-end development skills with cryptographic knowledge to provide a practical tool for understanding and utilizing different encryption methods in digital communication.
